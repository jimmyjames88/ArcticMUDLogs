falls about the room.  Strange lights begin to appear from the fires under
the cauldron and the smoke thickens and takes on a sulphuric stench.  The
fumes and lights begin to disorient you, but you continue to follow through
with the rite.
     As you near the end of the spell, you begin to hear voices whispering
almost within your head.  As they continue you hurry to finish the spell's
incantation, hoping to keep your sanity if nothing else.
     Suddenly a line of light appears within the middle of the room and
then stretches to either side to form a doorway.  And as you crush the
prism, you hear a cry of rage from beyond the doorway and a dim form
begins to coelesce before you, startling you so that you drop the final
element of the spell into the fire.
     And thus with a triumphant bellow, you face the full power of the beast.
