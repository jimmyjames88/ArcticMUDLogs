Base of the Spiral Staircase
     Small blocks of granite rise abruptly from the ground to form a spiral
staircase.  Their smooth, slippery surface appears to have been worn down
with use.  You can see a small antechamber to the north and a red brick
path leading off to the east.

     Echos of chanting resonate through this somber hallway.  The wail of

the pain and suffering it inflicts upon its victims.  As you walk down the

the evil pantheon upon Krynn once more as well as murals of entire villages
living in fear of the cults nefarious eradications of their populations.

steel gates.  There are piles of bones at either side of the gate,

Temple of Grak
     You find yourself to the west of the temple altar.  You see a tall
obsidian altar to the east.  Above it, hanging from the rafters is a large
faceless mask.  It sways gently as if watching for intruders. This part of
the temple, however seems to be used less than the other parts of the
temple which you have seen.  You think it might have something to do with
the deep red runes on the west wall.
