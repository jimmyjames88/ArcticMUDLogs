A Dark Tunnel
     The dark tunnel is much bigger than you would expect.  You see a few
scattered skeletons still in their suits of armor missing a few body parts.
Some large tracks on the ground lead in both directions.  From the room to
the south you hear loud breathing and rumbling.  The creature who lives in
the next room apparently does not treat visitors as anything but lunch.

A Dark Tunnel

of crude rock, chipped away many years ago. A foul smell flows forth from
the southern edge of the tunnel, while above you the path lightens as it
moves into a larger cave.

Before a Dark Tunnel

earth, the path narrowing from the wide cavern here as it delves into the
darkness. Light here comes from torches along the wall, which seem to be
totally absent from the tunnel below you. The cavern extends to the east,
into a wider passageway.

south but your lights are unable to penetrate the darkness from here.

A Huge Room
     This room is gigantic.  It is a multipurpose room that is used for
everything it appears.  Torture devices line the walls, a large table for
eating is on the west wall, bookshelves and reading tables are on the east
wall, a small arena type structure is built in the center, a few cots are
set up on the south wall for the guards, and just about anything else you
can think of in daily use is here somewhere.  Guards use weapons from a
rack in the southwest corner.  You have entered upon Kod's minions who will
give their life for their master.

Dark Mage's Bedroom
    This room is a standard mage's room with all the necessities. The mage
who uses this room must run the maze alongside the evil paladin, Kod. Both
use the students as a way to fund an army to overthrow the masters of the
school. They kill the students for their cash and sell off their equipment,
or try to coerce the best students they encounter to join them. This
instance however, the mage doesn't intend on asking you to join them.
