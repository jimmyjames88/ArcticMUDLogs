    This is a small, open field covered with long, waving grasses and a few
trees scattered across it. Around the field you can see the walls of the
Arena and it seems odd that the builders of this area would create a grassy
field here. The grass is very tall, around chest-height, and quite thick,
making you wonder what could be hidden in this field.

    When you enter the Arena, you are amazed to see that it is merely a
long, dusty hallway, with doors lining each side. It seems very long,
because the ceiling is open to the sky, and the sun beats down and makes
things hazy, as though you were in the desert. The walls of the hallway are
smooth marble, and the floor is made of sun-dried mud, stained with dark
blood in many places. From the many doorways, you hear sounds of battle,
and from time to time you hear a long, agonized death-cry.

    These are the stables of Gredt, a well-renowned horse-dealer among the
minotaurs of this settlement. He is known for his aggressive and strong
horses, able to carry the great weight of the minotaurs. The stalls are
made of a very hard-looking wood, and the stables are made of the same jet
black marble. It is rumored that only Gredt can approach his horses,
because they distrust all others.

marble, and the floor is made of sun-dried mud, stained with dark blood in

    When you enter the Arena, you are amazed to see that it is merely a
long, dusty hallway, with doors lining each side. It seems very long,
because the ceiling is open to the sky, and the sun beats down and makes
things hazy, as though you were in the desert. The walls of the hallway are
smooth marble, and the floor is made of sun-dried mud, stained with dark
blood in many places. From the many doorways, you hear sounds of battle,
and from time to time you hear a long, agonized death-cry.
