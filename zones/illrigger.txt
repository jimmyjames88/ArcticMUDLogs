Main Street
   This is the only stone cobbled street in Hylo.  It runs to the
east and west, under the tall and majestic trees of the forest that
Hylo is built in.  The faint bubbling of water can be heard from the
east, which must be the famed fountain of Hylo at the city center.
A breeze blowing from the east brings the tangy scent of the sea,
which lies beyond the fountain.

Main Street
   This is the only stone cobbled street in Hylo.  It runs to the
east and west, under the tall and majestic trees of the forest that
Hylo is built in.  Pine and oak trees provide a canopy of limbs,
resulting in a deep shade.  They also obscure most of the city from
direct sight, so that one would have to know it quite well in order
to be able to get where one was going.

   This is the only stone cobbled street in Hylo.  It runs to the
east and south, under the tall and majestic trees of the forest that
Hylo is built in.  To the north is Taunt Street.  The way to the west
is quite blocked by a briar of blackberry bushes.  Unfortunately,
some kender children recently passed this way, and there are no
ripe blackberries left on the bushes.

Smelly slime is splattered all over the rock on the floor of the cavern,
apparently having come from the hole in the ceiling.  The hole is placed
in such a way as most of the slime lands in the stream, and that which
doesn't slowly slides into the stream, as the floor is beveled towards
the stream.  An ancient ladder runs up one of the walls to the ceiling,
and it looks sturdy enough that one could still climb it safely.

Although I was vanquished quite easily, I have learned several things
in my captivity.  The only one whom the illrigger allows access to his
tower that is normally in this part of the keep is the priest.  He is
an evil sort, but he carries something which allows him access to
the main tower.
Also, beware the illrigger!  He is such as I, a holy warrior!  Yet
he follows the lawful evil gods, unlike myself.  His gods have granted
him great powers.  I have seen him cast spells like a mage, indeed,
he captured me alive by using the spell known as hold person.  He also

Smelly slime is splattered all over the rock on the floor of the cavern,
apparently having come from the hole in the ceiling.  The hole is placed
in such a way as most of the slime lands in the stream, and that which

the stream.  An ancient ladder runs up one of the walls to the ceiling,

Path Through the Plains
   A small footpath of bare dirt, worn more by the passage of animals than
humans, leads through the grass plains.  The path leads south, where it
eventually joins the Emperor's Highway, and to the east, where it heads into
the mountains.

   The walled keep towers above everything, its gates enormous constructs
of wood.  Tall towers are manned with staunch supporters of the Emperor,
and his pennant flies on the highest.  Although somewhat elegant, the keep
was quite obviously made primarily for defense, and it looks as if it
would be nigh impossible to breech in the event of a siege.

Inside the Keep
   From the inside, you can see just how well suited the keep is to defense.
High walls loom overhead, kept stocked with everthing from rocks to
boiling oil.  Even though the realm has been at peace for many years,
the Emperor has commanded that everything be kept in readiness.  A deep
well is sunk here into the flagstones, reaching down deep into the earth
to provide the keep with its own source of water.  Citizens and adventurers
are of course welcome to a refreshing drink of its cool liquid.  A path
around the inside of the walls extends to the east and west, and one
can also go south, through wide doors into the keep itself.

tradition maintains their importance.  To the south one can go further

into a courtyard of sorts.
