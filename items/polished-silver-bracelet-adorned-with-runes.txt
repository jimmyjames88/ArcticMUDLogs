You glimpse an image of a regal dargonesti elf walking across a perfectly
calm sea. The regal elf must be a leader amongst the dargonesti as there
are hundreds of other sea elves swimming in his wake. As Solinari's light
reflects off the water's surface, it creates a brilliant halo around the
regal elf. You sense that the reflected light might illuminate the hidden
channels of magic around him, but the fleeting sensation vanishes quickly,
leaving you with naught but a vague idea of what you might have seen.
